Overview:
This project was completed as part of our Web Development coursework. The challenge required us to work collaboratively in a group (2â€“5 members) and build a responsive, functional website using only the technologies covered during the week.

Solution Approach:
Planning & Collaboration:
We began by carefully reviewing the project brief and forming a clear plan of action. Roles were distributed among team members to ensure everyone contributed equally.

Technologies Used:
HTML5: For semantic structure of the website.
CSS3: For styling and responsive layouts (using Flexbox and media queries).
JavaScript: For interactivity and basic dynamic features.
Bootstrap

Development Process:
Followed a mobile-first design approach for responsiveness.
Built reusable components like headers, footers, and navigation bars.
Maintained clean, organized, and well-commented code throughout.
Regular Git commits to ensure version control and collaboration visibility.

Testing:
Tested the site on multiple browsers and devices.

Extra Efforts:
We also focused on accessibility (semantic HTML, alt text) and added minor creative features to enhance user experience.
